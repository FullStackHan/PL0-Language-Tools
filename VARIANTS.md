# Targets

## Retro

Developed by tangentstorm, this served as my initial model for the other targets.

## Parable

Parable is an experimental stack based language I'm developing. See http://forthworks.com/parable
for details on it.

Variable scope remains an issue at this time.

## ANS FORTH

Mostly a trivial adaption of the Retro target.
